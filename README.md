# Iowa Homes Prediction Model
Using R and SQL to create a machine learning algorithm that reads from a database

## Installation 
Start by installing the IDE's

[Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
[MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

Download R & MySQl
